# Second-Order Extended Kalman Filter for Extended Object and Group Tracking #
###Shishan Yang and Marcus Baum###



### About ###

This is a framework for Multiplicative Error Model for Elliptical Object Tracking. 

* Ellipse Parameterization: center, orientation, and lengths of semi-axis
* Measurement Update: Second Order Extended Kalman Filter (center is shifted for robustness)

For more detatils, we refer you to our paper.
